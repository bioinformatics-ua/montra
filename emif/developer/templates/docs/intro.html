            <h3>Concept</h3>
                <p>EMIF Catalogue, supports third-party creation of several types of components (by approved developers), that seamlessly integrate with the platform.</p>

                <p>The main aim is to permit the integration at several levels, and allow the platform users to contribute to the system's development, without having to understand all the technical details that make the system tick.</p>

                <p>This brief documentation intends to provide a general idea about the system, its several integration levels, as well as explain the existing API.</p>

            <h3>Plugin types</h3>

            <p>There are essentially three plugin types, available to third-party developers.</p>

            <div class="span8">
                <h4>Global Plugin</h4>

                <p>Global plugins usually reflect a general view over all the databases for a given user (or for all users).</p>

                <p>These plugins will be available at the root of the system, on the platform user dashboard.</p>

                <p>Examplse of a global plugin are the history feed and the tag cloud. They provide information that takes into consideration all the databases, and aggregate data in a certain way, displaying it to the user.</p>

                <h4>Database-related plugin</h4>

                <p>Database-related plugins reflect only views over a specific database data (both for a given user and for all users).</p>

                <p>These plugins will be available when a user opens a specific database, under section tabs.</p>

                <p>Good examples of database-related plugins, are the literature tab, or the extra information tab.</p>

                <h4>Third-party full-fledged applications</h4>
                <p>Third-party plugins don't have any real data integration with the platform. They are complete, full-fledged applications that are linked to the system, through the navigation menu. They usually provide a complete different functionality, though they may share some features like authentication with the platform.</p>

                <p>The main goal of this plugins is to integrate their application features in the environment.</p>

                <p>Good examples of these full-fledged applications are the future workflow-management system and the EHR4CR platforms.</p>

                <h4>Javascript Full-fledged applications</h4>
                <p>Full-fledged plugins have their own page in the navigation menu, similar to iframe applications, but can also provide data integration with the system. </p>

                <p>The idea behind this type of plugin is allowing the development of completely new areas to the platform.</p>

        <a name="pluglifecycle" class="anchor"></a><h3>Plugin Lifecycle</h3>

        <p>The plugin system has a very simple lifecycle, based on a re-rendering system. After the initial re-rendering, each time an event occurs (that should be caught through the usual javascript event listeners), the plugin should update the content using self.html() or self.append(), and when it deems ready, execute self.refresh() to update the visualization).

        <p>A diagram representing this interaction is shown next.</p>

        <a name="lifecycle" class="anchor"></a><h3>Development Lifecycle</h3>

        <p>To be sustainable, plugin development must follow a proper lifecycle.</p>

        <p>The first step is to obtain the administrator's approval to develop plugins.</p>

        <p>After that, the user can create any number of plugins. Each plugin can have a series of versions, although users can develop and live-preview their plugin versions during development. Whenever a plugin version is deemed ready to production, it must be submitted for administrator's approval to become available.</p>

        <p>Any further changes to an already approved version will remove the approval status, and the plugin will have to be submitted again.</p>

        <p>The plugin version available for the other users, is always the biggest-numbered approved version (considered the latest stable version).</p>

        <p>A diagram of this development cycle is shown next.</p>
